### `cold-open.sh` 🧊

**Usage:** Run from Raycast and enter the URL (scheme optional). Include any query params directly in the URL.

```
> Cold Open
> Enter url: foo.vercel.app?timings
→ "Opened https://foo.vercel.app?timings (profile: /var/folders/.../tmp.XXXX)"
```

> ⚠️ Quits all open Chrome windows.

### `killport.sh` 💀

Kill a process running on a specific port. No more hunting for PIDs.

```

### `video-first-frame.sh` 🎬
